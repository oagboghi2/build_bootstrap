### Stage 1: Reverse Engineer Bootstrap Components

- [x ] Styles include replicas of Bootstrap's typography:
  - [ x] [Headings](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-headings)
  - [ x] [Body copy](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-body-copy)
  - [ x] [Addresses](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-addresses)
  - [ x] [Blockquotes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-blockquotes)
- [x ] Styles include replicas of Bootstrap's [buttons](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons)
- [x ] Components include replicas of Bootstrap's:
  - [ x] [Button Groups: Toolbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-groups-toolbar)
  - [x ] [Breadcrumbs](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#breadcrumbs)
  - [x ] [Pagination](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#pagination)
  - [x] [Labels](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#labels)
  - [x ] [Badges](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#badges)
  - [ x] [Jumbotron](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#jumbotron)
  - [ x] [Page Header](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#page-header)
  - [ x] [Thumbnails](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#thumbnails)
  - [ x] [Alerts](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#alerts)
  - [ x] [List Group](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#list-group)
  - [x ] [Panels](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#panels)
  - [ x] [Wells](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#wells)
- [ ] Each component is featured on the demo HTML page `demo.html` under its own header along with the code used to generate it (for a simple example of what this could look like, see https://purecss.io/buttons/)

### Stage 2: Modify the Styles

Now it's time to make it look good ðŸ˜Ž. Make changes to the CSS (not the HTML) to apply your own styles to the design.

- [x ] Demo page `demo.html` shows components/elements with customized styles, including (but not limited to):
  - [ x] A different typeface (take a look at [Google Fonts][google-fonts] for inspiration)
  - [ ] A unique and different color palette (take a look at [Adobe Color CC][adobe-color] for inspiration)
- [ ] Style should be cohesive, connecting the elements as a whole. For example, a similar color palette is chosen.

### Stretch

- [ ] Demo page for stylized components is published as a [GitHub Pages site](https://pages.github.com/)
- [ ] Site includes instructions for how to include and use your framework
